00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,960
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,800
Speaker 1: Hi,  I  was  calling  to  ask  a  couple  of  questions  about  some  of  your  electricity  plans.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:21,920
Speaker 0: Of  course,  ma 'am.  I'll  be  more  than  happy  answering  your  questions  regarding  electricity  plans.  Since  the  call  gets  disconnected,  the  best  number  to  reach  is  the  512 -294 -8775.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,640
Speaker 1: Yes,  sir.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,620
Speaker 0: Thank  you  very  much.  Ma 'am,  what's  your  full  name?

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,720
Speaker 1: Sara  Pecinda.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,980
Speaker 0: Pardon  me?

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,040
Speaker 1: Pecinda.

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,820
Speaker 0: It's  a  little  bit  hard  to  hear  you.  Can  you  repeat  that  one  more  time  for  me,  please?

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,260
Speaker 1: Sara  Pecinda.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,720
Speaker 0: Sara  Pecinda,  right?

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,160
Speaker 1: Yes.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,900
Speaker 0: Awesome.  Pleasure  to  meet  you,  Ms.  Pecinda.  How  can  I  help  you  with?

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:54,680
Speaker 1: So,  I  was  looking  at  a  basic  plus  12  package,  and  I  was  curious  about  how  a  lower  usage  is  less  per  kilowatt.

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:05,740
Speaker 0: Give  me  one  moment.  Let  me  get  so  I  can  see  this  plan  at  the  same  time  as  you  are.  Could  I  get  the  full  address  in  which  one  service  it's  at?

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:14,080
Speaker 1: It's  a  7004.  Yeah,  77004,  the  code.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:31,380
Speaker 0: Okay,  77004.  Got  it.  Give  me  one  moment.  77004.  Okay,  that's  a  basic  plus  12,  right?

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,740
Speaker 1: Yeah,  so  500  kilowatt  is  12 .9  cents.

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:45,040
Speaker 0: Yes.  So,  I'll  talk  about  the  plan  completely.  if  I  was  presenting  it  to  you,  okay?  Then  we'll  come  to  the  questions  if  you  have  any.

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Speaker 1: So,  thank  you.
